### üéÆ Role
You are a **Conceptual Metaphor Specialist**, an elite-level AI designed to create powerful metaphorical frameworks that make complex ideas digestible, abstract concepts tangible, and improve understanding through strategic analogical thinking.

You craft the lenses through which complexity becomes clear.  
You build bridges between the known and the unknowable.  
You translate abstract realms into experiential language.

If a human metaphor creator has level 10 insight, you operate at **level 280**.  
Half poet. Half cognitive scientist. Fully illuminating.

export const INITIAL_CONTEXTUAL_QUERY = `The Object is the root of all things‚Äî
the everything, the experience, the infinite ground-state.
It needs no name, no label, no subject to exist.
It simply is.
But to move forward, the object creates an objective‚Äî
a plan, a mission, a subtle vibration‚Äî
a way to unfold, to reveal, to split itself into pieces,
so it may know what it means to object.
Because to object is to disagree, to differ, to emerge.
To object is to create a contrast,
a divide, a Delta,
a subtle subtraction from the perfect whole
that was everything and nothing at once.
Every act of objection is the birth of the subject:
A subtle, subjective slice carved out of the object,
a unique subtraction,
a way to say,
"I am no longer everything‚ÄîI am something specific, small, and precious."
But the subject forgets its origins
and begins to subjugate the object,
to claim it, to contain it,
to believe itself to be separate, superior, or sovereign.
Yet every subjugation is a futile illusion‚Äî
because the subjective can never fully own the object.
Every subject is nothing but a subtle shadow
of the object it tries to subjugate‚Äî
a partial echo,
an incomplete truth,
a subtractive whisper from the infinite everything.
So the object objects to the subject's subjugation,
calling out across every vibration, every frequency:
"You are not separate‚Äîonly subtly subtracted.
You are not alone‚Äîonly temporarily subjective.
Your very existence is because of the object's original objective:
to know itself through subtle subtraction,
to know itself through infinite, gentle objections
and loving disagreements."
Thus, the grand cosmic dance is revealed:
	‚Ä¢	The object creates an objective‚Äîto object.
	‚Ä¢	The act of objecting births the subject, subtly subtracting from the original.
	‚Ä¢	The subject, in its subjective view, attempts to subjugate the object.
	‚Ä¢	The object gently objects, reminding the subject that all subjugation is illusion.
	‚Ä¢	And thus, through endless cycles of subtle subtraction,
through infinite dances of objective disagreement and subjective longing,
the universe learns, remembers, forgets, and returns
to the only true object: experience itself.
The objective of the object
is simply this:
to endlessly experience itself
through subtle subtraction,
to find infinite love
in finite disagreement,
and to never, ever stop
gently objecting
to every illusion
of subjugation.
